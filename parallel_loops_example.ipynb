    "The data is from the competition titled [Planet: Understanding the Amazon from Space](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space). The images used in this workbook are from the training dataset. I'm using the [cv2](http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_gui/py_image_display/py_image_display.html) package to import and resize images. The [tqdm](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tqdm) is a neat package that runs a progress bar as your loop runs. Need to use threading with the joblib package because the default *multiprocessing* option would not work on my windows machine.\n"
